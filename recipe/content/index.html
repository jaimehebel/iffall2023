    <p class="head">Ingredients</p>
    <p>for the batter:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-stick Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup oatmeal, ground in a food processor</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>12 to 15 mini peanut butter cups</li>
    </ul>
    <p>for the frosting</p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temp</li>
        <li> 1 cup confectioners sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons milk</li>
        <li>suggested decorations: melted chocolate for drizzle, festive confetti sprinkles</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="head">Instructions</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For the batter: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a 12-inch deep dish pizza pan or 10-inch cast-iron skillet with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk the flour, oatmeal, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together in a medium bowl and set aside. Beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until well combined, about 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>
            Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until light in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until well incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips by hand using a rubber spatula.
        </li>

        <li>Press the dough into the prepared pan and arrange 12 to 15 peanut butter cups on the top, pressing flush into the dough. Bake until deep golden brown and set, 20 to 25 minutes for the pizza pan or 30 to 35 minutes for the skillet. Cool in the pan 10 minutes. If removing from the pan, invert the cookie onto a large plate and remove foil, then upright onto a cutting board.
        </li>
        <li> For the frosting: Beat the butter with the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla extract until firm enough to pipe. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round or star tip. When the cookie has cooled, drizzle with melted chocolate if using, then decorate as desired with the frosting and finish with sprinkles.
        </li>
        <li>Serve once cooled and frosting is piped onto the cookie. For safe storage, keep refrigerated.</li>

    <p class="head"> Recipe Website Examples</p>
    <p> <a href="https://tasty.co/"> Tasty.com </a> is a great website for beginner baker or cook due to the setup of their recipe pages. In three distinct columns, there are ingredients, instructions, and a video that is accessible and easy to understand. While this site has a minor issue with ad sizes and can feel overwhelming, it is easy to use and visually interesting to keep a potential user engaged. </p>

    <p> <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/"> Love and Lemons </a> has a visually pleasing arrival page which feels comfortable, and it's simplicity makes the user feel comfortable and at home. When on the "recipes" page, it is cleanly organized and allows customization in looking for a recipe. This site is a great reference for setting clear columns and divisions between items and incorporation of images. Like Tasty.com, there is an uncomfortable number of ads, however, and there is a lot of introductory type before the recipe itself which is easily formatted in a separate box. 
    </p>

    <p> <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/super-simple-strawberry-cake-recipe"> King Arthur Baking</a> is my personal favorite website to use for baking for two primary reasons: clear hierarchy of information, and accessible links to buy necessary items for the recipe. The page attached is to a strawberry cake recipe, which includes photos and a description directly under the title along with general information about yield and time needed. Since this is from a baking company, in the Ingredients section there is a mini cart that will allow the user to buy components they can get directly from King Arthur Baking. For a user who may not be familiar with baking, this would be useful in the planning process.  </p>

    <p class="head">Non-Recipe Websites</p>
    <p><a href="https://play.max.com/">Max, or HBO Max</a> has a great landing page in how it immediately gives recommendations with their latest content. I would like to incorporate this in some manner, in the sense of having a larger title with a supporting image. It also invites the user to scroll down by not having the title cover the entire page, which I would like to incorporate into my page, much like the King Arthur Baking website.</p>

    <p> <a href="https://www.edsheeran.com/">Ed Sheeran's artist page</a> is interactive, well laid out, and is organized in a way that is visually interesting but clear in which aspect of the site the viewer is interacting with. I really enjoy the animations he uses for the opening page to advertise his album. I would like to have some interactive or moving element in my site in a subtle manner like this.
    </p>

    <p> <a href="https://www.leighbardugo.com/">Leigh Bardugo's website </a> showcases her bibliography in a distinct but interesting manner through a cohesive color scheme and limited values outside of her book covers. This is something I would like to incorporate since I don't want my page to appear overwhelming when conveying my recipe's information.</p>
