    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Hi! My name is Jaime Hebel and I am a junior majoring in Communication Design.</li>
        <li>I am interested in learning more about UX and UI design, as I have only worked in traditional mediums until this point.</li>
        <li>I have no background in coding.</li>
        <li>Something I hope to learn is how to design easy navigation around a website, since this is something that often bothers me as a user.</li>
        <li>I think it will be very different in the sense that I cannot move things around as easily on a page as I can with 2D surfaces. If I need to move one thing, it will risk moving other elements around the page instead of a single one.</li>
        <li>https://www.apple.com/         I think Apple.com is a great example of effective web design. There is a clear visual language throughout their website in typographic choices to the presentation of 3D models of their products. As the user scrolls down on the pages of each product, the 3D models of the product rotate to reflect where on the page they are. It immerses the user and invokes the feeling of being on a journey with the product rather than simply presenting the product as it is.</li>
        <li>https://www.nytimes.com/       The NYTimes homepage is a great example of communication in web design. Not only do they mimic their physical newspaper, but the visual hierarchy of their headlines is clear when you open the website. Each category is clearly organized into sections under the header, and is smooth and easy to open, making for easy communication to the user where to find articles that interest them.</li>
        <li>www.pinterest.com Pinterest as a whole has a great setup, modern feel, and helps users find images and curate their feed easier than most social media platforms. While I understand their goal and concept of curating a lot of content in a short span is not the best as a consumer, their website does accomplish this goal successfully and is easily navigable and makes organizing “pins” simple yet fun for the user.</li>
    </ol>
